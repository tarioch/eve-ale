TODO list for next point release
- Add the ability to autoload class files to the library, and change api-testing to use this
- Malformed XML throws an exception - might want to catch that and attempt fetching XML once more. On 2nd thought, we can't re-fetch because of the current layout of the library. What a PITA. At least the exception can be caught.
- If XML in cache file got corrupted, we need to be able to discard that file and fetch anew
- Function to clean up the cache - maybe on a few levels: All by freshness, all by userid regardless of freshness, all by charid regardless of freshness
- Think about re-ordering parameters in class.api.php to be more consistent across functions in their order, as long as this does not impact the public interface

TODO list for 0.23
- The additional rowsets in charactersheet aren't being parsed
- We have multiple rowsets in membersecurity, and would have to either do a charactersheet-style custom parsing, or redo / rethink the way we parse into an array. Consistency would be good, but
breaking existing code might be bad.
- Add a way to know whether we fetched from cache - getCacheStatus maybe
- Add a way to know what API error occured - getAPIError maybe
- getStandings requires alteration for Alliance, return array for Char to change to an equivlant format as Corp/Alliance Array - done
- Add test cases for the added functions to api-testing 
- Document added functions
- Change caching logic so no cache file is created if $api->cache(FALSE) - done, needs testing
- Add some caching logic that can handle binary file timeouts
- (Re)test API functions that have changed in Revelations 1.1
