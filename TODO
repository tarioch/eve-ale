TODO list for next point release
- Add the ability to autoload class files to the library, and change api-testing to use this
- Malformed XML throws an exception - might want to catch that and attempt fetching XML once more. On 2nd thought, we can't re-fetch because of the current layout of the library. What a PITA. At least the exception can be caught.
- If XML in cache file got corrupted, we need to be able to discard that file and fetch anew
- Function to clean up the cache - maybe on a few levels: All by freshness, all by userid regardless of freshness, all by charid regardless of freshness

TODO list for 0.23
- Fix/finish the handling of 101/103 errors in WalletJournal/Transactions
- Possibly change 103 handling if current refid not 0: Change cachedUntil of previous refID
- Add 100 error to documentation as something that can happen on 2nd fetch
- Add new utility functions and changed behavior of WalletJournal/Transactions to documentation
- Add tests for utility functions, particularly the ones that aren't crucial to the functioning of the lib, such as the ones to retrieve cache
- Add handling of 115, 116, 117, 119 to assets, industry jobs, market orders, kill logs
- Document changed handling of assets, industry jobs, market orders, kill logs
- Change current code to only do the special handling if timeour is NULL, indicating that the user wishes the library to follow cachedUntil as best it may


TODO list for 0.50
- Captured in branch; not duplicating it here
