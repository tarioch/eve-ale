TODO list for 0.23
- caching method doesn't handle 0 length files in it's cache, fix added
- evecapi class files created but only a basic retrieval not supporting a caching functions yet exists 
- getStandings requires alteration for Alliance, return array for Char to change to an equivlant format as Corp/Alliance Array - done
- Addition of MemberSecurity, MemberSecurityLog and Titles to be added - done
- Addition of remaining API classes CharacterName CharacterID ErrorList and the ID to image service (done bar image)
- Add test cases for the added functions to api-testing 
- Document added functions
- Add the ability to autoload class files to the library, and change api-testing to use this
- Change caching logic to deal with currentTime and cachedUntil being identical (indicating that the result should not be fetched from cache) - done, needs testing
- Change caching logic so no cache file is created if $api->cache(FALSE) - done, needs testing
- Malformed XML throws an exception - might want to catch that and attempt fetching XML once more. On 2nd thought, we can't re-fetch because of the current layout of the library. What a PITA. At least the exception can be caught.
- If XML in cache file got corrupted, we need to be able to discard that file and fetch anew
- Function to clean up the cache - maybe on a few levels: All by freshness, all by userid regardless of freshness, all by charid regardless of freshness
- Think about re-ordering parameters in class.api.php to be more consistent across functions in their order, as long as this does not impact the public interface
- Add some caching logic that can handle binary file timeouts
- (Re)test API functions that have changed in Revelations 1.1
