TODO list for 0.22
- Caching is broken now that I use cachedUntil. Find the bug and unbreak it
  - One bug found w/ regards to checking against the wrong time
  - Still get api "wallet exhausted, try again with an hour hence" - yet the caching only specifies 15min. We may not be able to rely on cachedUntil universally.
    eve-dev lists this as "long" caching, yet cacheduntil is only 15minutes. bummer.
	Yup, it's a known issue - see http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=802053.
- Test caching well before release
- Got an XML parse exception once on the accountBalance - find out what that might have been about.
- Updated documentation

TODO list for 0.30
- Redo the core to follow OOP principles. This will change calling conventions.
  - Better error reporting. Throw exceptions where that is warranted, use PHP error function otherwise
  - api class is abstract; eveapi extends it eve-specific, and evecentralapi for evecentral. tqeveapi is specific to tq, and sisieveapi to the (announced)test server api
    What should be in the abstract class as far as functions and vars go is TBD
  - All api functions move into their own distinct class files. There'll be an abstract class, and extensions. in the abstract, we need get, getxml, and parse, possibly others. get calls getxml and
    parse in sequence. getxml grabs the xml in cache / via api call; whereas parse parses and returns an array. The class should "know" about the data structure, so it is reasonable to have
	properties that hold the data. Been looking into read-only variables in php through the use of private and overloading some magic functions, that may be a way to go. To be discussed. No
	"cooked" data in these classes. They can then be extended again to get cooked data, in a later release or by developers as contributions, if so desired - this would be useful for market data,
	pos data, and asset data to name a few. The idea is to not have to touch the "core" to get additional functionality, and to be able to extend to new eve api calls easily, again without 
	touching the existing core. Oh, these classes get passed an instance of api (eveapi or evecentralapi, etc), which they use to do the "dirty work". That way, one class can work on tq, sisi,
	chinese, and whatever else may come along.
  - Allow the useragent to be specified, so applications can be unique that way
  - Look into the use of __autoload, possibly in a registered way so as to not clash with a web framework's __autoload. Would get rid of the need for all these require_once statements
  - Test against PHP 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2. That means that 5.2-only niceties such as the extended http_build_query and the ability to do generic type hinting through E_RECOVERABLE are out
  - Look at curl instead of fopen - not sure what it gains me?
  - Look at xpath - Lumy suggests it is a better alternative to simplexml
- Implement the rest of the API functions

TODO list for 0.31
- Add non-EvE EvE APIs, such as the one that eve-central is offering for market transactions

TODO list for 0.32
- Add a view into static data export, possibly using sqlite so it can be self-contained. Look at tying that into the asset data, though that'd be in an extended class. Currently quite shaky on
  how the "view into data export" would work, even.

Beyond? Don't know yet. Extending classes by utility functions and "cooked" data, maybe
