TODO list for next point release
- Add the ability to autoload class files to the library, and change api-testing to use this
- Malformed XML throws an exception - might want to catch that and attempt fetching XML once more. On 2nd thought, we can't re-fetch because of the current layout of the library. What a PITA. At least the exception can be caught.
- If XML in cache file got corrupted, we need to be able to discard that file and fetch anew
- Function to clean up the cache - maybe on a few levels: All by freshness, all by userid regardless of freshness, all by charid regardless of freshness
- Think about re-ordering parameters in class.api.php to be more consistent across functions in their order, as long as this does not impact the public interface

TODO list for 0.23
- Change file headers to reference the new name of the library, once we've decided on a name
- (Re)test API functions that have changed since Revelations 1.0 - done, I think
- Fix/finish the handling of 101/103 errors in WalletJournal/Transactions
- Possibly change 103 handling if current refid not 0: Change cachedUntil of previous refID
- Add 100 error to documentation as something that can happen on 2nd fetch
- Add new utility functions and changed behavior of WalletJournal/Transactions to documentation
- Add utility functions to retrieve the cachePath, which will also help with fixing the current code as it is now

TODO list for 0.50
- Captured in branch; not duplicating it here
