version 0.21b13, 2008-07-05 (release candidate)

class.api.php changes:
- Yorick: Acting on Lumy's suggestion, reworked the caching logic with a sane(r) way to create paths
- Yorick: Added individual cache timeouts to all public "get" functions
- Yorick: Acting on Lumy's suggestion, added a public function setCacheDir($dir)
- Yorick: Debug output when creating cache files
- Yorick: Clarified some debug messages
- Yorick: Fixed a bug that would zero out $params in retrieveXml, even if it was passed. Oh, Lumy found that too - changed to match Lumy's suggestion.
- Yorick: Added some BUGBUG comments for things that may need followup
- Yorick: Redid getCorporationSheet to use $corpid as a parameter. Removed $corpid from setCredentials again.
- Yorick: setCredentials will "null" out charid if it is not passed - allowing you to "go back" to charid-less credentials if you so desire
- Yorick: Changed all public "get" functions to take optional $timeout and $cachethis parameters. 
  These parameters come last, so should not break existing code.
- Yorick: Added parameter checks to all public functions, and the odd private one. This should help users that pass non-numeric charids, and the like
- Yorick: Changed the default caching behavior to be "true"

class.balance.php changes:
- Yorick: Changed the getAccountBalance parsing class. It was the only one that extended API and did its own retrieveXml. It is now in-line
  with all the other parse functions. The old functionality has been retained for backwards compatibility, as well.

class.transactions.php changes:
- Yorick: Changed the class name of Transaction to WalletTransactions and its method to getWalletTransactions, to be in line with other parsing classes. Again, the old class "Transaction" has
  been maintained for backwards compatibility, as well.

class.charactersheet.php changes:
- Yorick: Fixed a minor parsing error in getCharacterSheet()
- Yorick: Added a class SkillInTraining, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.generic.php changes:
- Yorick: Added classes SkillTree and RefTypes, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.membertrack.php changes:
- Yorick: Added a MemberTracking class, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.charselect.php changes:
- Yorick: Added a Characters class, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.starbases.php changes:
- Created parsers for getStarbaseList and getStarbaseDetail, with classes StarbaseList and StarbaseDetail, respectively

Other changes:
- Yorick: Started on API documentation in doc.rtf
- Yorick: Added API testing code in the "sample" subdirectory.
- Yorick: Consistently return "null" in parsing functions if passed parameter is empty or not a string

version 0.20r1, 2008-03-06
- Rynlam: added class.corporationsheet.php, class.alliancelist.php, and changes to class.api.php to support corpid in setCredentials
